### LinkedIn Post
```
I've been exploring Claude Code CLI, and it's changed how I think about AI-assisted development.

Instead of line-by-line prompting, you can:
• Give strategic direction ("Build a SaaS that...")
• Let AI make implementation decisions
• Focus on what matters (product, users, business)

Created a comprehensive guide covering the full workflow.

Key topics:
✅ Autonomous development mode
✅ Agent architecture
✅ MCP and tool extensions
✅ Product delivery pipeline

## Constraints
- Don't make unsubstantiated claims
- Don't compare negatively to competitors
- Keep claims accurate and verifiable
- Respect Anthropic's brand guidelines

## Handoff Protocol
After marketing work:
1. Document changes in session-log.md

3. If new assets created, organize in marketing/
4. Track any metrics if available
